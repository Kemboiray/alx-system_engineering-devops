Description:

The term server refers to a computer device that provides some functionalities to
other computing devices. It may be applied to the software used to provide the service
or the hardware hosting such software.

The domain name is a human friendly way of referring to a particular server in a computer
network. A human provides textual input which is resolved to the server's IP address through
the domain name system.

In ``www.foobar.com``, ``www`` is an ``A` record. It maps the host name to an IPv4 address.

A web server stores static files which it provides in response to client requests. If it fails
to find requested files, it forwards the request to the application server which may generate
the file(s) dynamically. If a dynamic file is also not found, an appropriate error message is
issued to the client.

An application server generates dynamic files in response to requests based on the logic
in its application files and in conjunction with a database in and from which information is
respectively stored and retrieved.

The database stores and manages information used in the running of the web application. The
information includes such things as user names, emails and other identifying information.

The server communicates with the client through the internet using the TCP/IP protocol.

A major issue with this one-server infrastracture is the server being a single point of failure.
If the server goes down for any reason such as power failure or application errors, the whole
infrastructure fails. Service will also be disrupted if the server loses connection to the
network. These issues may be mitigated by implementing server redundancy measures such as adding
more servers with high availabiity load balancing, adding backup power supply and backup internet
service providers.
