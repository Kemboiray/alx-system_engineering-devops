Two servers and a load balancer have been added to the design to increase the infrastructure's
capacity and provide high availability.

The multiple web and application servers are configured with the same files so that they all
serve the same content when requested. A load balancer is added between the client and the
servers to intercept and distribute traffic from the client(s) among the servers. For this
implementation, the load balancer uses a weighted round robin distribution algorithm: a certain
number of successive requests are passed to one server based on the weight assigned to it; the
next set of requests are passed to the next server, and then the next until all servers are
covered at which point the cycle repeats. The load balancer is enabling an active-active set up
since all servers actively share the client load.

A database primary-replica cluster works by having one main authoritative database (referred to
variously as master, primary, leader etc) and one or more clones (aka slave, replica, follower etc).
The primary database handles write (and sometimes even read) operations while the replica(s) are
only involved in read operations. Whenever a write is done in the primary database, all replica
databases are accordingly updated. In case the primary node goes down, one of the replica nodes is
upgraded to primary status, taking up its role; once functionality in the downed server is restored,
it rejoins the cluster as a replica.
