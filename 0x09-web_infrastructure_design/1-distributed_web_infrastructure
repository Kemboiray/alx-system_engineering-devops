To upgrade the one server infrastructure to a three server infrastructure, we will introduce
additional servers to improve redundancy and distribute the workload. Here's an overview of
the upgraded infrastructure:

  * Load Balancer: We will introduce a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple
    servers, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization. The load balancer acts as
    a gateway for user requests and directs them to the appropriate server.

  * Web Servers: Instead of a single web server, we will have multiple instances of the web server
    (Nginx) running on separate servers. These web servers will handle incoming HTTP requests and
    serve static content. They will be identical in configuration and serve as a pool of resources.

  * Application Servers: Similar to the web servers, we will introduce multiple instances of the
    application server. These servers will run the code base and handle dynamic content and application
    logic. The load balancer will distribute requests among these application servers to balance the load
    and improve performance.

  * Database Servers: To ensure redundancy and scalability, we will introduce dedicated database servers.
    These servers will run the MySQL database management system and handle data storage and retrieval for
    the application. Multiple database servers can be configured in a master-slave or master-master
    replication setup to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.

  * Domain Name Configuration: The domain name ``foobar.com`` will still be configured with a "www"
    record, but now it will point to the IP address of the load balancer instead of a single server.
